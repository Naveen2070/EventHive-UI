    steps:
      # 1. Check out the code
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v6

      # 2. Set up Node.js (Use the version matching your local dev)
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v6
        with:
          node-version: '22'
          cache: 'npm'

      # 3. Install Dependencies
      # 'npm ci' is faster and more reliable than 'npm install' for CI environments
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # 4. Type Check (Optional but recommended)
      # This ensures you don't have TypeScript errors that would break production
      - name: Type Check
        run: npx tsc --noEmit

      # 5. Build the Project
      # This runs 'vite build' and creates the 'dist/' folder
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      # 6. Upload Build Artifact (Optional)
      # This saves your 'dist/' folder so you can download it from GitHub
      # or use it in a deployment job later.
